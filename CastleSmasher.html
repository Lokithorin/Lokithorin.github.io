                "Castle Smashers" is a 3D physics-based puzzle/shooter game made in Unity. It was inspired by the Angry Bird Games. <br>
                This was a solo project where I wanted to learn and experiment more with Unity's physics systems <br>
                I needed to be able to create destructable environments for this game. To do this I researched and created fractured objects using blender (versions of the object which are split into pieces as if cracked) <br>
                On top of this, I created a high score system, implemented animations and visual effects to bring it closer to a complete game.
