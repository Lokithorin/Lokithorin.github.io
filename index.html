    <h1>Loki's Game Development Portfolio (WIP)</h1>
    <p> Hi, I'm Loki Rogers, a Video Games Development student at Birmingham City University.</p>

    <h2>C++ Platformer Game</h2>
    <h4> C++/SDL </h4>
    <p>
        This is a 2D platformer game, inspired by and styled to be similar to old Super Mario games. I made this using C++ and the development library SDL, with aid of the software "Tiled" to create tile maps for the game levels. <br>
        This project was done without an engine, so required me to create my own collision and physics system as well as implement camera movement throughout the levels. <br>
        To create the levels in the game, I made use of "Tiled" to be able to easily create a tile map and export it as a .tmj file which could be read from in code as a series of integers representing a type of tile in it's respective position <br>
        This allowed me to give specific tile types different properties such as making them breakable or even turning them into entities which act as enemies in the game.

    <h2>Scrap Forge</h2>
    <h4> C#/Unity </h4>
    <p>
        "Scrap Forge" is an Isometric 3D Action-Adventure game set on a forgotten planet, collapsed, unloved, and filled with junk littered everywhere. Playing as a robot called "Scrappy" you have crash-landed on a lonely world. 
        Scrappy now must explore and learn about the planet's past to find parts to repair their ship. However, it won't be as easy as other robots will try to stop you each step of the way. 
        This game was made at the end of my first year at BCU and had the whole Development class working alongside students studying both Video Game Design and Art.
        These 3 disciplines were split into 8 teams, each focusing on a specific area of gameplay. 
        I was the lead developer for the "Enemies Team" as well as co-lead developer for 3 other teams, in charge of distributing features to be implemented to members based on their skills whilst still also developing features myself.
