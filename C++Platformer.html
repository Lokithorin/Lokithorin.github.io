                    This is a 2D platformer game, inspired by and styled to be similar to old Super Mario games. I made this using C++ and the development library SDL, with aid of the software "Tiled" to create tile maps for the game levels. <br>
                    This project was done without an engine, so required me to create my own collision and physics system as well as implement camera movement throughout the levels. <br>
                    To create the levels in the game, I made use of "Tiled" to be able to easily create a tile map and export it as a .tmj file which could be read from in code as a series of integers representing a type of tile in it's respective position <br>
                    This allowed me to give specific tile types different properties such as making them breakable or even turning them into entities which act as enemies in the game.
