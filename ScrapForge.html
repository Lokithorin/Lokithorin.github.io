                    Scrap Forge is a 3D Souls-Like Action-Adventure game made in Unity. It was a large scale collaborative project. <br>
                    "Scrap Forge" is an Isometric 3D Action-Adventure game set on a forgotten planet, collapsed, unloved, and filled with junk littered everywhere. Playing as a robot called "Scrappy" you have crash-landed on a lonely world. <br>
                    Scrappy now must explore and learn about the planet's past to find parts to repair their ship. However, it won't be as easy as other robots will try to stop you each step of the way. <br>
                    This game was made at the end of my first year at BCU and had the whole Development class working alongside students studying both Video Game Design and Art. <br>
                    These 3 disciplines were split into 8 teams, each focusing on a specific area of gameplay. <br>
                    I was the lead developer for the "Enemies Team" as well as co-lead developer for 3 other teams, in charge of distributing features to be implemented to members based on their skills whilst still also developing features myself.
